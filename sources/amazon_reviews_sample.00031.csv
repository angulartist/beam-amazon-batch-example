Amazon,0,4,If you want to listen to music you will have to sign for Amazon unlimited or Prime which is very expensive. Pandora does not work too well with this device as it does with Google Home.,Great product but requires Amazon membership...,Neeko,TRUE,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,9,5,"I have grown very accustomed to having Alexa around. There are new skills added on a very regular basis. I really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song/radio station/podcast to be played. I also enjoy having books read to me- since I'm not much of a reader. The setup was super simple- so simple that I wasn't sure that I was all ready to go with such minimal effort. The battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine. I feel that there is a bright future for the Tap and I am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer. I'm not sure I ""needed"" this item- but I can't imagine not having it around now. So pleased with this purchase.",As a Prime member- this is ideal for me,TempeDiablo,TRUE,2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,7,4,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with.

Amazon,0,4,Enjoying my Tap- asking Alexa questions- and the small form factor makes it easy to take along while traveling. Decent battery life and sound for such a small speaker.

Amazon,0,5,Bought the Echo Tap- Echo Dot- Phillips Hue Starter Kit and a Honeywell Thermostat for my wife for her birthday.She loves it and so do I!Cant wait to add more automated products to it. No need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature- check weather- play music- etc.- I just ask Alexa to do it while I continue at what I'm doing.Also- when the Dot and Tap are in the same room- the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests.

Amazon,0,5,"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",The Perfect Bluetooth Speaker...Plus So Much More!,CellPhoneGuy,TRUE,2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I was looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but I didn't want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months. This speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by Alexa- and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound. The speaker quality is great for a portable option. The only thing that I don't like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right- but I can't knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem.,"Great ""dumb"" speaker",NeoBlaze,TRUE,2017-01-19T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Love it- works better than anticipated. Also at a good price,Great device,Jusandy25,TRUE,2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,When it works I love it,Rickyvic,FALSE,2017-02-04T00:00:00.000Z
