Amazon,2,5,I never owned a Kindle before. This was easy to setup and get going.It also looks really good. The text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. I also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.,Looks good- easy to setup,Caskade,TRUE,2014-12-25T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,6,4,Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage- the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.,Best Kindle but not Perfect,Jeff,TRUE,2015-01-16T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,1,5,This eReader is great- I have started reading more now that I have this kindle than when I read paperbacks. If you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else I can almost guarantee anyone would love this. With enabled dictionaries and X-ray I'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like Game of Thrones. I'm serious- this is so convienent and user friendly. The only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to Amazon with it.,Wow,Knight,TRUE,2015-08-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,27,3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money.

Amazon,1,5,We bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go wonky.

Amazon,1,4,Moving to this from the first generation Paperwhite appears to have been the right move. I love the new size- it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. The new automatic brightness setting works quite well. I do wish I could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however- as I have frequently hit them accidentally. The page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.,Another improvement on the Kindle line,opsmgr3774,TRUE,2014-11-04T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,19,1,My Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving emails from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode- switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. If I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.,Amazon Voyage dead trying to update software,floridapete,FALSE,2016-03-17T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,2,5,This is my first e reader. I did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. The screen is awesome. I read a lot at night before I sleep and I use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. But with voyage I can read as much time I want. No strain no burning sensation in my eyes. Compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. Feels like I am actually reading a paper book.,Best e reader anyone can get,Sunny,TRUE,2015-07-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I upgraded my Kindle to the Kindle Voyage because I read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. I thought I would be able to use this Kindle without the lamp- but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. I still use the Kindle with the lamp on- but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid- the Kindle wakes up. It is a little smaller than my old Kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. All in All I LOVE it and would highly recommend it.,Light weight and easy on the eyes,kls6199,TRUE,2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing.

Amazon,0,1,This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said- you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately- it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email- so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.,Too may preloaded useless apps,HDelbrucke,FALSE,2017-04-25T00:00:00.000Z

First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off.
