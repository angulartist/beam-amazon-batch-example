Amazon,0,4,This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card- for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!,Well constructed,Bevykay,TRUE,2017-03-27T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I bought this for my daughter- wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games (like with the kindle fire). This latest version of the kindle is excellent. I am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. The touchscreen is responsive. If you like reading on the kindle- it is worth the update.,great update,johnjohn,TRUE,2017-01-08T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more.

Amazon,0,5,Initially we purchased the Kids Kindle Fire for our 3 year old. The parental controls and time limitations are super easy to set up. We have a Samsung Galaxy tablet that our 9 year old son uses- but we ended up getting a second Fire for him because it seemed very kid-friendly and I didn't have to worry about any inappropriate content popping up. Lots of good educational apps and games.,Liked it so much I bought two!,rocknrolljessie,TRUE,2017-04-01T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft- yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case.

Amazon,0,4,My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case- and we can control the games he plays- and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger- it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.,Perfect for Little Techies!,Mommyof4,TRUE,2017-01-31T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,13,4,I was worried that it would have lag- but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE)- because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter- although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.,Love the response time,LadyNixie,TRUE,2016-08-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,The tablet is pretty good- I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store- that is one of my only big complaint.

Amazon,1,5,Product is good- light. Amazing battery backup. I charge the Kindle one in 4 weeks. Great product for reasonable price. USB connection is easy- Books are easy to download. Overall- everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably- this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights- White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights. But again- for this price you would not get any other good readers.If you are someone who reads in dark then I would suggest go for Higher Kindle models.,Nice Product of Kindle begineers,Priyesh3d3,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,Does what it says- missing one key feature,Nola,FALSE,2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,1,The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps- and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years- but Android - who is the ultimate culprit- has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger- there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue- then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more- but is much much more reliable.,Chronic issue with charging port,Melissa0414,FALSE,2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z
