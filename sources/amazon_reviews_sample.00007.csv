Amazon,0,5,We have all three Echo products in our house. Each with a different usage. Got the Show for my parents and sister as well to communicate as we all live in different places. More for my parents- its ease of use is ideal for them- no computer knowledge needed- speak and they can connect with us.,Best ECHO Product,Seminoles808,TRUE,2018-01-30T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,You will be amazed how this works for many questions you ask and Alexa has the answer. However do not expect her to know everything. You will be happy with this purchase.,Amazing how this works.,BigEd,TRUE,2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Between this product and Siri- AlexaIs much more useful and reliable. It controls many things in my home and is very dependable. Only one problem... commercials activate Alexa when it hears them.,Alexa wins,Rick,TRUE,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I didn't think I needed Alexa to have a screen- but now I'm so glad we got this. When I ask to see my grocery list- it pops up on the screen. Also can do video calls from it. Really like our Alexa and the dots...we have them in almost every room of the house now.,Love Love Love,rickh1235,TRUE,2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,Wish the angle was adjustable. When this is sitting on a table or counter it is angled up and the further away from it you sit- the less likely it will see you in its view when trying to call someone. Love the Sirus XM update to play through this though. The speaker seems louder and better than the regular Echo- but that is just my thought. If you were able to get two for price of one- this is a deal worth taking.,Great Device,mwright286,TRUE,2017-08-07T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,First bought the Dot to see if we liked it. We enjoyed it- but wanted a little more volume. When I saw that the Show was much louder and had the camera we decided it was the right choice. Now we have the Dot in the bedroom and the Show in the living room. For larger rooms the Show is a great choice.,Worth the extra bucks,zimm,TRUE,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I was against getting something in my house like this being skeptical about hackers watching thru the device. However- this is the greatest thing since sliced bread! It can do just about everything! And the sound is fantastic when steaming music! Being able to change the dish network channel by saying it is so convenient while hands are in the flour (for ex.)! Access to information is endless and immediate with her replies! We love it!,Better than expected,Pootoos,TRUE,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,this is pretty cool- we love ours- we listen to music and the sound is great- my kids are always asking her questions- we can call on it- set reminers- timers and alarms for us it was worth the price but one thing I dont like is that it nickles and dimes you- like even though I have a prime membership- all music is not available - I had to pay to upgrade to be able to listen to everything and it doesnt stop there- even though I upgraded it -if you purchased the dots not everyone can play music at the same time- to do that youll have to pay to upgrade again. but even so I dont regret this purchase and the whole family enjoys it.,,Floridamom,TRUE,2018-06-06T20:46:55.000Z

Amazon,0,5,The Echo Show is hands down the best device of the Echo lineup. I‚Äôve bought at least one of everyone except the Tap. I use this to call and check on my grandparents- who I got one for Christmas. It‚Äôs amazing watching my arlo and ring cameras on the screen.

Amazon,0,5,"This is a perfect upgrade to my kitchen Amazon Echo. The speaker itself is a substantial upgrade over the Echo and Dot. I have it connected to my Nest security cams and it's great to check on my dogs when they are having play time in my fenced backyard. It can be a bit distracting with it's random invitations to ""try"" certain skills- but the distraction is worth it! This product absolutely represents the future that I imagined when I first watched Back to the Future 2 decades ago! The only con's that I can think of is sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me so well (same for the Echo and Dot) and it currently can't differentiate between users like Google Home can. I have had the Google Home too- and would highly recommend any of the Amazon devices over the Google Home.",Perfect,enforcereric,TRUE,2017-07-20T00:00:00.000Z

I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill- made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem.

Amazon,0,4,I recently had purchased enough smart home devices to make this a good addition for the home. It works well with smart outlets- our Ring doorbell and fairly well with our Nest Thermostat.My only complaint is that sometimes for no reason it will start plying a movie trailer and it's hard to get it to stop. Still all in all we're happy with the purchase.,Like it!,MikeH,TRUE,2018-02-23T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson- but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well- were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone- but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room- but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable. I really like playing games like Jeopardy with Alexa. No climbing through the closet to find a box anymore- and when you do find it box half the pieces are missing.,Amazon - Echo Show - White,Alt2Max2,TRUE,2018-01-20T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,"I have had the Echo Show for about a month now. So this review is from a new user whom has never had smart devices aside from cell phones. Alexa is great for listening to music- most of it free if you're an Amazon Prime member- pair your Echo device with a bluetooth speaker for awesome sound. Alexa works well with smart home devices such as light bulbs- outlets and thermostat. (Most of these are really easy to set up- so you don't have to be a very technical person.) All of which can be voice controlled or remotely via the Alexa app from your smart phone. If you have a friend with an Echo Show- you can make video calls via the devices or directly to a smart phone which is pretty awesome for family and friends whom live far away. As far as answering questions- do not expect the best answers. The Bing search engine needs some work. If you want to ask the questions she prompts you with on an Echo show- she's your girl- but if you want to know something- you might have to look it up yourself. IE, weather forecast- you get whatever Bing uses and the short version. If Bing would expand their horizons in searches- I would definitely 5 star this item. She does fairly well with recipes and shopping lists. I am going to be trying out the calendar sync portion of this with my wife after the holidays. All in all- very fun- helpful- item. It can order you pizza too.",Needs better search engine.,Jimmy,TRUE,2017-12-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,So we added this to our Echo family of devices. It's nice to have screen- but I honestly don't find I use it as much as I thought I would. The video calling feature would be pretty great IF we knew more people with a video capable Echo device.... Also- we've had some technical issues that I haven't been able to resolve as of yet. Ultimately- this is a powerful little gadget and can be fun to pop on a movie while sitting at the kitchen bar counter. It's also awesome to be able to display our security camera feed for the outdoor cameras- but you should probably investigate it's features and your needs before splurging on this over one of the more 'traditional' echo devices. It's essentially an Alexa enabled tablet with a nice speaker- so something to think about.,Fun and has nice features,SarahD,TRUE,2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z
