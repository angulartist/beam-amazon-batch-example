Amazon,0,4,I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use- it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend- I would- but would make sure they knew what I use it for.,Good for what I use it for,BobS,TRUE,2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games.
