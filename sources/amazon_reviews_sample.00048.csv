Amazon,4,4,Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size- but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books.

Amazon,2,5,I gave my Paperwhite to a friend and bought the Voyage. I like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages.

Amazon,2,1,The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models- they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!,Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,Paloma,FALSE,2016-12-24T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it- I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small.,Good,Customer,FALSE,2017-07-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor- which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage- is that it's much lighter- it's brighter (LEDs)- and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover- but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant- hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall- it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best- then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though,Best Kindle yet,JLT421,TRUE,2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,12,5,I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most- but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof),Amazon got it right this time,Chris,TRUE,2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,1,5,I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny- portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black- brown and red (red was my choice.- which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!,Awesome! I love it!,ChiKali,TRUE,2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact- even with the cover- and fits in a coat pocket.

Amazon,49,5,"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand- Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release- April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles- including the most recent Paperwhite model- I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing- but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise- the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact- the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort- For frequent travelers like me- this is a key reason to buy one of these- as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots- no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface- helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear- better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart- since they are held together with magnets. After doing so- this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear- as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue- and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates- and the page turn buttons also ""follow""- with the top button always used to advance the page- and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery- so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover- which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner- more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward- as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints- and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads- it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps- but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes- then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit- and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not- but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader- this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",Remarkably Small and Lightweight,Sluggo2013,TRUE,2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z

She tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. She writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the Kindle did its notes. For just reading I think it would be a very nice product.,I liked it,oldjohnsr,TRUE,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Was a gift to replace older one and she really likes this one. Light and the battery last much longer.,Upgrade gift for wife,jncneal,TRUE,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,6,5,Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight- the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds- and any book I choose instantly opens- ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing- the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold- and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF- most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words- I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed- and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open- it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page- it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day- I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well- not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First- you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes- but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me- and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second- the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third- this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day- and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18- and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far- but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off- I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now- I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason- I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on- color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction- and to be honest- they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months- would I still have bought it? Yes- I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white- would I still have bought it? Yes- I would have.,Reasons I Love My Kindle Oasis,ljbinion,TRUE,2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,"With the cover attached- the battery lasts for a good- long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily)- the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book, and- it fits into my pants pocket- again- perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days- but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless- it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",Perfect for traveling,Geno,TRUE,2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,It fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. Lightweight- especially without the case. Shape of back provides easy grip. Accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. Would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate- but that's a minor thing.,Great size for traveling,Bbshop,TRUE,2017-07-09T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,1,5,New to eBooks and researched available eReaders and tablets. What I like best about the OASIS is the weight (lightest on the market)- battery life (measured in weeks not hours) and the capability to use it in bright sunlight.

Amazon,0,5,I have had a Kindle for some time and was curious about the Oasis. It did not disappoint. It is very compact- even with the cover- and fits in a coat pocket.

Amazon,1,5,I thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite- but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. I have owned a Kindle since the second generation version. This is by far my favorite. The look and feel are amazing. I don't regret the purchase one bit as I have the disposable income to do so- but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.,Best Kindle Ever,ShowMeSenate,TRUE,2017-05-12T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,13,5,'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard- 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all- this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy- it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.,The definitive Kindle.,Chris,TRUE,2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z
