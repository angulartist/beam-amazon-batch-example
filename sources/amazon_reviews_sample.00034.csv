Amazon,5,5,I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. The Oasis is no exception- even from the highly touted Voyage model. It is expensive but the lightweight design- improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. This is definitely a good investment!,The reviews are right-this is the best Kindle ever,rlmgolfer,TRUE,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,16,4,I got oasis yesterday- very lighweight compared to voyager- screen size comparable- like having actual page turn button- touchscreen seems kinda slow- the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy- but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on- then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port- so all charging is done thru kindle.,Voyager replacement,Bobby,TRUE,2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,This Fire 10 is so much better than my old Kindle Fire HD that I now wonder why I waited so long to upgrade. The 10' display is awesome and the speed is very good.

Amazon,0,3,We bought this because we thought it would be great for reading books and playing a few games. However- awkward size makes the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable. The Fire HD 8 shares the exact same specs and has a higher battery life. There's almost no reason to take this device over the 8.,Get the Fire HD 8- Not the 10,Brad,FALSE,2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,15,5,When they first announced the Kindle Oasis- I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot- so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life- I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again- I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out- I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite- and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot- especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite- like when reading in the dark- I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis- I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience- although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite- which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand- which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand- at times I would accidentally go back a page- which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice- just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite- and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy- but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight- ergonomic design- and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.,Not for Everyone- but I love it.,Want300,TRUE,2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Small- light- but comfortable to hold with either hand. If you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting- the battery last for weeks. Lovin' it so far.,The best Kindle yet,dempshw,TRUE,2017-02-03T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,3,5,This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed. If you can get past the jump in price (remember you're not having to buy the case separately)- it's a quality product to have.,Best Kindle yet,ssc6,TRUE,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I absolutely love my Kindle-Fire HD 10 16 GB. I can read it day OR night without light. And the picture quality is amazing! I haven't had any problems with it so far other than it's so thin- you need a case so you don't drop it. Very easy to add games- music- and books. I have even ordered items through Amazon without problems. I highly recommend this product.,Love my Kindle Fire HD 10 16 GB,Ckkparker,TRUE,2017-07-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,10,5,I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most- but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof),Amazon got it right this time,Chris,TRUE,2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,The Amazon Fire tablets are nice tablets. They're especially great for streaming tv and movies. And since it's a Kindle it's great for books too. It is a little odd with the Internet browser- and still a little limited in the app store. But overall a great little tablet.,Nice little tablet.,Chris,TRUE,2017-05-18T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,makes reading easier and more enjoyable in that I can see a whole page at one time. The protective cover that Best Buy sell was a disappointment in that it covered the On/Off switch and did not hold the tablet very well so that I had to find another cover from another source.,Great price and value and very easy to use.,phyther,TRUE,2017-08-05T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go- but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later- I got this for a gift- and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day.,Great e-reader- no complaints,DebraPants,TRUE,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,"I have an old Kindle Touch- the last one that still had text-to-voice- which no longer works. I decided to upgrade- started reading the reviews- was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek- with neat features- and I enjoyed using it for a few days- but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice- I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located- plus- I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet- so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However- the clarity of the screen- the quality of the light- the form factor- the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless- the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light- and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page- or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it- but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However- it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object- I'd say get the Kindle Voyage- if it is- the Paperwhite is a fine little reader- and overall I'm happy I have it.",Loved the device but not the price,AmoM,TRUE,2017-09-23T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...,great kindle,klett,TRUE,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I or a family member have owned every version of the Kindle since it came out. This version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous Kindles and combined them into one unit. It is small and light- has both touch screen and button functionality (depending on which you prefer - I'm a fan of the buttons)- and an excellent back-light. Kindle battery life has always been excellent- and is no different here. I use my Kindle daily- often for at least an hour at a time. The only downside is that I'm not sure what other features Amazon could add to improve this version- other than perhaps making it lighter weight. By far the best e-reader out there- and a worthy upgrade from a previous version,Best e-reader,Matt,TRUE,2015-12-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions- especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store.

Amazon,9,5,Great looking display. Text is sharp and easy to read. The lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. This is a little more compact than the paper white model. I really love the page press button areas.

An extra bonus for me is- it fits in a pocket I wasn't using in my pannier I carry stuff to work everyday. I love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. I also love that I charged it when I got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.",I love the Kindle Voyage,JKL73,TRUE,2014-10-31T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,The new design is lighter- has a longer battery life and the page displays are crisp and clear. The light adapts to the environment you are reading in to keep the image consistent. The new Kindle Voyage is amazing!,like a book but better,Gameon,TRUE,2016-02-15T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device- and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However- I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks.,Terrific reader!,Delver1,TRUE,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,9,5,I have a previous version of the Kindle- but this one surpasses it in every way- from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. Recommend it highly.,Best Kindle yet,Dave,TRUE,2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,The Kindle voyager is absolutely a best product for reading ebooks. The product is easy to read in all types of light. I also like the ability to get word definitions and the expansion or text ability.,Excellent reader,Augie,TRUE,2018-03-21T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,6,5,Upgrading from an older Kindle. Wow. Lighter. Crisper text is an understatement. Throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. Pricey but if you want the best- you won't be disappointed.,Best e-reader,BradmanTX,TRUE,2014-12-26T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,2,4,It's a great eReader and the font is much clearer than that of the Paperwhite- but that may not be enough to justify the extra $$$. The page turn buttons are a great addition too.Would be good if Amazon would add audiobook capability though.,Worth the $... For me.,swhittak,TRUE,2015-06-28T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I've always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now I've resisted moving to electronic media when reading for pleasure. Now I wish I hadn't waited so long. Reading at night with the lights off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspects.,Can't bring myself to buy printed books any more,BestShane,TRUE,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,1,5,We upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.,Upgrade!,Deebs,TRUE,2015-08-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I have had several variations of the Kindle in the past. My most recent being a paperwhite. I have to say this is the best. The size and balance are better. The adaptable light feature and brightness is good. Screen quality and construction are both an improvement. The overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite.,Great Kindle,Creede,TRUE,2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,5,5,I really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. I love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. The voyage is perfect- easy to read anywhere- much longer battery life than a fire. Very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.,Love it- take it everywhere!,Star,TRUE,2015-02-06T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,"I had to ask for help because they don't keep this model on display- it's ""behind the counter"". But other than that- in-store was a breeze. And the product exceeds my expectations. Although- it would be even better if it was waterproof--- but it does perfectly fit into a medium baggie.",Excellent! Just as advertised.,Bobb,TRUE,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z
