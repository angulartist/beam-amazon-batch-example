Amazon,0,5,This amazon echo is awesome- my girl loves it- im happy,Echo,Cleanbuddha,TRUE,2018-03-30T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,3,The three star review is for the situation described here- not the quality of the unit. I ordered this online and picked it up in store. The package was very securely sealed the seals appeared to be factory. The Echo was wrapped in plastic and looked like it had never been out of the package. When I hooked it up- however- it said that the unit was registered to someone else. It wasn't a problem to get it registered to me and the unit works fine. I spoke to both Amazon and Target about this- and neither could tell me what happened. I was offered an exchange if I wished. I chose to keep the original unit- but I wanted to make others aware of the issue. I have one theory. Target has a buyer who purchased a lot of these for Target resale- and they are all registered to this person. I guess I'll never know. The Echo itself works fine and I'm very happy with it. After you hook it up- make sure to go to settings and download the latest updates. Then you should be good to go.,Is it used or new,Swamprat357,TRUE,2017-12-19T13:11:59.000Z

Amazon,0,5,This does the same stuff as the traditional Echo or Echo Dot- except it has a screen. If you already liked the Echo's this is a good addition. The addition of the screen is neat- but certainly not essential. You can see daily news headlines and the weather scroll across the screen. You can watch any Arlo or similar cameras on it. You can watch YouTube and Amazon Video as well- but you'll probably just watch that on a phone- tablet or TV instead.,If you like the Echo- you'll like this,CHeil402,TRUE,2017-09-22T00:00:00.000Z
