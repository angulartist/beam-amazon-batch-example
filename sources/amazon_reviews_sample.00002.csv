Amazon,0,5,I was a little hesitant to spend the money to get this but I am so glad I did! Alexa always answers when I say the commands and I have noticed it is probably 95% right with any command that I have given. Love the fact that I can see things on the screen. Some of my news briefings have a picture/video so that's nice too. We also love the video call option. Planning on getting one for my grandma who is not as technologically advanced- and could just sit at a table and talk with the grandkids. Worth every penny.,So simple and powerful!,Tess,TRUE,2018-02-25T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I have both an Amazon Echo and Amazon Show and prefer the Show with the video screen. I use the Show to display recipes when cooking- lyrics to the music I‚Äôm listening to and video conferencing with my family. I like seeing headlines of stories scroll across the screen along with the t8me and temperature.,Love the Amazon Show,Dakotaice,TRUE,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,Little putsy so far- but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows- he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding- but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house.,Lot of potential,KrissMG,TRUE,2017-07-21T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,It's at its heart an echo- but having a screen on it- with 1000s of things to do with it make it a much easier recommendation over the simarly priced screenless echo plus,The Screen changes everything.,Falloutboy210,TRUE,2018-05-18T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,Great for music,drollins431,TRUE,2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,It‚Äôs awesome being able to control the lighting and lots of other controls with this!,Very cool,Russell,TRUE,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,I‚Äôm a big echo fan- so this seemed like a no brainer. I like it a lot- but I‚Äôm disappointed about google pulling YouTube functionality. I also feel like the original echo speaker sounded a little better and listened better with kitchen related background noise.,Lots of potential,JeffW,TRUE,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I was jealous when our son showed us his Amazon Show and some of the things it was capable of doing. Since AOL eliminated Instant Messaging- my wife and I were less able to communicate because our offices are on separate floors. So we got two Shows and two Spots and now not only can intercom easily but use Alexa for music and many other things. We will probably start using some smart home devices which Alexa can also control. It's a fun device which seems to be getting better all the time.,Terrific product,DonR,TRUE,2018-02-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,We use this as a monitor for the amazon cloud camera! Works great we tell it to show us the camera -and boom- there‚Äôs the video feed. Super easy to link our echo plus and the echo dot with the show!!,Great product!,Trentendo,TRUE,2017-12-16T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,We bought the two-for deal as presents. My mother will have a learning curve- but since the other one is going to my son- he can teach her! Looks like a neat appliance- but want to see if it can do more than weather- music and turning off the lights...,Christmas presents for my mother and son,laf452,TRUE,2017-12-20T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Very fun to have music at the ready with a voice command. We use it with Amazon Unlimited which has nearly everything. Good to view recipes with Allrecipes- so we keep it in the kitchen for reference and musical ambience. The video is good too- it has youtube functionality. It would be nice to have regular tv though- but that is probably on the providers for now.. nice to have the photo background and lastly- to have lyrics on the screen when music is played!,Just love it!!,TeejSC,TRUE,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I was using the original Echo seldomly. Then I decided to get the Show... I use the Show a lot more. Was simple to set up and you can make calls with video. Great product,Simply Awesome,JM808,TRUE,2017-11-03T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,2,I have to say it was a little confusing and frustrating when i was not getting the verification code from amazon - i waited for 20 minutes then i requested another code- nothing... then a nother one... and still nothing - i started to set up the device at 8.30 am and by 11.20 am i was fed up with it.. i had to step away.... after about 5 hours we went shopping and at the mall i recieved about 4 codes from amazon ....,not big fan,Davedz87,FALSE,2017-12-30T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,My dad uses this as a speaker for the tv ...and loves it. He does use it in the traditional Alexa way...but the speaker option he discovered is an added benefit.,Fun,Loop,TRUE,2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,Alexa may be new- but I would have thought some of the simple commands she would have been able to respond to already. For the amount Amazon charges- it should come with better instructions- including what specifically to download into one's device (iPhone- etc.) so as to make some apps ready to go. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.,not as intelligent as I was told,ZIGEPS,FALSE,2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,16,5,I previously owned a Nucleus device which was similar to this device but was not a great device and had a lot of bugs and did not do much so I returned it. This device is a masterpiece! Not only is it tied into the Alexa Echo universe- it can be used as an intercom throughout your house with other Echos and also can be used to view things and even call people that have Echo directly. It is an amazing piece of hardware and Amazon should be proud of themselves for developing such a beautiful device!,Returned a Nucleus for this gem and it is a beauty,recruiter89,TRUE,2017-06-28T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,I like having the screen and being able to see things like weather reports- etc. Still not using it to its full potential- but we have it controlling a couple of lamps- giving us weather reports- setting timers and alarms. It's making me lazy! Sometimes it doesn't hear my voice. Hears my husband's voice better. I find it best to put it pretty close to me on a side table.,Happy with it,Linda,TRUE,2018-03-24T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,40,5,"When I first read about Amazon Echo Show- I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size- which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo & it is compatible with most existing security cameras- so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2- so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date- with stronger bass- directional stereo- Dolby Audio & focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder- with less sound to the sides & back- so you do not share your music to all- as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7"" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover & the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator, Volume UP & Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa- just as with Echo or Dot- & Show mutes the volume & shows what you asked on the screen- with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast & you get written & verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days- including real feel- a picture of the anticipated weather- chance of rain- etc. 11- Say: Alexa- show me the ""Front Porch""- or any of the numerous security cameras & within 2 seconds- there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet- so I cannot try this but call yourself & you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors & iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface & are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device- this is one you will want in the center of your desk- as shown in my photo- because once you add the video component- you will wonder how you enjoyed music- sports- & just about everything- without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast- that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT- but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos & Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",ECHO SHOW is a MUST HAVE for Amazon Echo Fans!,gadgetguy11,TRUE,2017-07-17T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,At first I was concerned with the funny looking angle I saw on the pictures. The item was not displayed at the local store so I decided to take a chance. As an owner of the Echo Dot i figured it would work in the same manner and it does. I love that it works with the Arlo Pro. The screen is great and I soon figured out the reason for the funny angle of the item. The angled screen works great Only setback or recommendation would be to add a auxiliary output at the rear. Also you can watch prime movies- YouTube videos etc.,Echo show,Biffthebully,TRUE,2017-07-20T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,"For some time I have been searching for a replacement for my Sony DASH which had support discontinued recently. While I am sure that being a bedside ""smart"" alarm clock was not the primary goal of the Echo Show it does fit the bill nicely. This was my first Echo purchase and now I have multiple Echo's and HUE lights. Great system all around!",Great Device!,pgadget,TRUE,2017-08-13T00:00:00.000Z
