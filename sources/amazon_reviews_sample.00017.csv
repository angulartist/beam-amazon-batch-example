Amazon,0,4,This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad- I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales- they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then- I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.,Best Kindle for my needs*,DavidB,TRUE,2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child- but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days- plus the cost- I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in- they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet- glad I got the bumper too- great price,Great kids tablet,Wifeofrecentespressolover,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series- trilogies etc. Is impossible- and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.,Love this Fire!,ExtremelyUnhappy,TRUE,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z
