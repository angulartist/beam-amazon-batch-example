Amazon,0,5,I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior- and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more.

He has several game systems- Xbox- sega- ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own.

Amazon,0,4,Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time.

Amazon,0,1,Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books- since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone- It is toast. Bought it October 11- 2016 - It quit on February 9- 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers- lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk- I am not just offered more apps- it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK,less than 120 days- about 100 use. It is toast!,PatF,FALSE,2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose.

Amazon,2,1,The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models- they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!,Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,Paloma,FALSE,2016-12-24T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I am really enjoying my new kindle fire hd 8. The picture is awesome even for a movie. I use it mostly to read with an occasional game or movie too. Colors are great and the size of the screen is very nice. I have a 7 inch fire and there is enough size difference for movies etc to make it worthwhile. Plus there was a great black Friday price.,Great product,Michelles3,TRUE,2017-01-18T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,1,5,"For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet- and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day- and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb- but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing- email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall- probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",Serves my tablet needs perfectly,SpartyForLife,TRUE,2016-12-04T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,105,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past- mostly from the Samsung line- but this is my first Amazon Fire- so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written- Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First- while this device runs an Android type of operating system- Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said- if you are an Amazon Prime member- this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines- books- etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen- but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps- but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them- you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First- you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik- Amazon's own internet browser- Audible- Good Reads- the Amazon app store- a weather app- etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter- Facebook- etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps- however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device- when you have a new issues- it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos- however- you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app- which is a cloud-based app.So far- I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said- I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen- you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books- videos- games- shop- apps- music- audiobooks- and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example- if you have Kindle books you've already purchased- they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me- but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it- but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member- Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device- but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now- I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office- I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine- anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store- but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys- but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets- but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop- however- that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone- it's not as shape- but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone- the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion- they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app- but still your music will sound tinny. That being said- you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker- use a pair of headphones- etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera- but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also- I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag- but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck- particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag- this device may be OK for you.",Great price on an awesome little tablet,Jenn,TRUE,2016-10-05T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,This tablet is designed primarily to sell- distribute and store media purchased from the Amazon.com product line- ie Kindle e-books- movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service- etc.- and it does that very well.Reasonably sharp screen- good sound- good battery life and decent component materials. It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store- but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent- but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.,Excellent Portable Media Device / Backup Tablet,BB808,TRUE,2017-01-31T00:00:00.000Z
