Amazon,0,4,I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles- books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall- well worth the money.,Great Starter Tablet for Kids,AmateurGoProer,TRUE,2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,2,So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes- I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix- but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app- clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all,Disappointed doesn't play Netflix,Toshalee,FALSE,2017-03-16T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops- the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat - only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money- tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.,Great Tablet for Kids,Tony,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 - but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. The games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it- it doesn't effect the tablet. My only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot (sorry I don't know the technical terms haha) so sometimes I will think it is charging and in fact it is not. I recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.,Great for a 2 year old,April,TRUE,2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z
