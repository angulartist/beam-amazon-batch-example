Amazon,0,4,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great- and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However- the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon- thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned.",Nice starter tablet for kids,JACV,TRUE,2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,33,5,This is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. And you should definitely pay the extra $20 (for a total of $69) and get the 16 GB tablet. Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications- etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire- without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games- watch movies/tv- surf the net- email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products- but I am obviously not one of them.,Great deal on a great basic tablet,Amazonqueen,TRUE,2016-06-22T00:00:00.000Z
