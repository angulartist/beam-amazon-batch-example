Amazon,3,1,"Less than useless Does not work with Amazon CloudCam. I purchased this from Best Buy to allow me to monitor my two Cloud Cams from my kitchen. I am VERY tech savvy and have numerous Alexa devices but have been unable to get it to work. I tried installing and enabling the Amazon CloudCam Skill- made sure there were no new updates for the Show (the Show automatically updated when I first plugged it in). The final straw was when the tech support rep told me you can‚Äôt use the Show with the CloudCam‚Äîand then was unable to connect me with someone who could actually solve the problem. Useless is no help, less than useless actually makes more work. The Echo Show is less than useless.",Less than useless. Doesn‚Äôt work with CloudCam,Woody,FALSE,2017-11-22T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However- the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But- who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues.

Amazon,0,3,The show has some nice features but the audio quality isn‚Äôt the best for the price point. I got mine on sale and am just using it for a bedroom alarm clock. I can read the time without my glasses.I still use my Sonos Play 1 to listen to my sleep playlist and ny other music.

Amazon,0,5,The unit does a good job of playing music from Amazon music. It hears your voice very good although it gets confused at times when I tell it to turn on a particular lamp and I have to slowly pronunciate it. Like that the music shows the lyrics. Do need a family account on Amazon music to plan different music on different units in different rooms at the same time though.,Great for music,drollins431,TRUE,2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show- they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function- sound quality- picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music- pictures- videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere- my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size- that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system- robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful- fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.,Amazon Awesome,SkyWatcher,TRUE,2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,I picked up the show on a Black Friday deal. I probably would never have paid full price. I am glad I have the show- it is actually quite useful. The sound quality is also better than the standard echo. At the moment- my only complaints are the lack of YouTube support and the price.. It will be interesting to see what features Amazon will add to the show in the future.,Overall- I like the show,bsn6,TRUE,2017-12-15T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,5,5,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both.

Amazon,0,3,"We bought the Echo Show to get the hyped benefits of Alexa- and home automation. After using for a week- we decided to return the Echo Show. Alexa just isn't ready for prime time. 90% of the time we got the ""I can't answer that"" response to questions. It's a waste of money for us. Say ""Alexa- Say good bye!""",Echo is OK- but Alexa not ready for prime time,steve,FALSE,2018-02-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,This product ties in to the Amazon ecosystem better than the Dot or Echo. It provides better sound quality and plays video. Pairing this off with Nest cameras has been the best. So quick and easy. I highly recommend this product.,Great Product,AdmiralQ,TRUE,2018-01-29T00:00:00.000Z
