Amazon,0,4,Battery life isn't great- but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it- the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so- despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet- but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue.,Pretty solid for the price,G8rgrad98,TRUE,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units- for basic web surfing- email- and especially shopping on Amazons web site- this tablet performs well- although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate'- but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall- I am pleased with this tablet-so far.,Not fancy- but it will get the job done,link,TRUE,2016-12-30T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,I love having real books- but these are great for travel and keeping your bookshelves lighter. I wish you could buy them with larger storage without having to buy the larger size pad. It also sucks that they are 4gig- but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background- so it's less bright on the eyes.,Okay,frheel9,TRUE,2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,Great tablet except...,CDDs,TRUE,2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games- apps and videos available to them based on their age.

Amazon,0,5,Purchased for my 3 year old- love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever- since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS- but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device- no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy- but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all- it is a great device for little ones- but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.,Perfect for preschooler,Kim3,TRUE,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z
