Amazon,0,5,"I had Microsoft Surface- unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks- email- games- internet search- and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses.",Awesome tablet for me,JWF46,TRUE,2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
