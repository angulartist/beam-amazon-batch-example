Amazon,0,5,So my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. However my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my Ipad- but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. Which makes the Kindle Fire tablet for kids the best invention since the Tivo. All the pre loaded apps- videos- books- etc is nothing short of amazing. The case is also very cool- hardwood floor and stair case proof. For under $100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine.,Perfect for all ages,Skyline,TRUE,2017-03-25T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos.

Amazon,0,3,I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go- but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol.

Amazon,2,1,I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game- it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.,Slow!

Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy- like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't.
