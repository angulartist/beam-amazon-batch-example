Amazon,0,4,Purchased the Echo Plus after reading that the new generation had been upgraded by improving the sound and integration of a controller. For the price provided- I thought that the deal was a good value. I have the first generation unit as well. A quick comparison of the two from a sound- look- etc perspective really didn't lead me to think that there was any noticeable sound improvement nor improved aesthetics. At least the price for the unit has come down quite a bit and the addition of Philips bulb for 'free' was a smart move.Overall- I think that the unit is a good purchase for beginning some home automation projects.,Echo Plus,Krampus,TRUE,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z
