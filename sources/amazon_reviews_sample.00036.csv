Amazon,0,5,This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps- hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles- books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device- but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games- apps- books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members- delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time- alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day- sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.,Best Decision I Ever Made,LadyG0726,TRUE,2017-02-22T00:00:00.000Z
