Amazon,0,5,I already have 6 Amazon devices (2 Echo's and 4 Dot's). I expected this device to be slightly different as it is the only Amazon device I have with a screen. I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of helpful features that a screen could bring. It occasionally scrolls suggestions across the screen- and most of them have been very helpful. I'm planning on setting another one up at my 93 year old mothers house. She'll get a kick out of it also.,More features than I expected.,Gibzilla,TRUE,2018-09-15T16:34:29.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Bought 3 of these for Christmas for my Family members.I‚Äôve had mine for a year in my Kitchen and just love it!So much you can do with it and works great with my 5 Arlo Pro cameras.Big plus...Amazon is Always updating the Show to do more.,Love Echo Show,TheDigialGuy,TRUE,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,"Despite a less than friendly price point (if you don't get it on sale)- this Amazon item is well designed and delivers on the promises in the hype and product description. The emphasis with this item is ""show""- so it's no surprise that sound quality does not compare with the Echo- but if you want the convenience of a voice controlled screen other than your phone- this product delivers. It's value is even greater when paired with other smart devices such as security cams. Another added bonus comes when friends or family also have a Show- so that you can do ""drop in""- which is essentially visual phone calls. It's great for checking on elderly family because it does not require them to be technically savvy.",Delivers on promises,Spanky,TRUE,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Previously had 2 echo Dots in play at my home- so knew I wanted more from my Alexa. Echo show now in kitchen and allows easy review of youtube for entertainment and recipe instructions. Also like streaming music and having the lyrics stream- too!!! Very cool. Looking forward to Alexa learning more and more to respond to my questions on various topics. Hands free is the way to go.,Love Echo Show,Boomerchick,TRUE,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,"The Alexa Show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the Show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that I had in the older device. I'm not sure if I'm missing it in the Show but I was able to get internet cameras on the older device (such as San Diego Zoo Elephants) that you can't get on the Show. While certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch. Setup was pretty straight forward and easy. It is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent. It is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want. (such as ""play"" or ""start"" or ""open"") I use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then 4 more or other combination. You would have to set up several different alarms- one for each day as far as I can see. Some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming- I don't really want to be terrified awake each day. I found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well. It would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what you'd like. I don't see that yet anywhere. Another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off. If you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times I'd rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe- which is possible- but very sensitive and if you miss- here comes snooze! Just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly. I am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so I can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time. Hoping that works well when it arrives.It will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed. All in all I'd say it's a good emerging technology but needs a little work. Considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago It's kind of where we're heading.",It's not a bad device,Robert,TRUE,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell- and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes- you can talk to it- and get results for almost any query- but with the show- you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls- especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon- or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you- but SHOWN to you. Also- when music plays- you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing- and you SEE the news- highlights- etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series- but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used- the screen shows a picture of your choice- making it a digital frame too. Overall- the device is very nice- and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use- so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights- adjusting your thermostat- playing music- viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties- there is WAY more to do with this device!,Alexa is very useful,discwizard70,TRUE,2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),Love this,LisaCT,TRUE,2017-11-25T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show- they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function- sound quality- picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music- pictures- videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere- my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size- that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system- robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful- fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.,Amazon Awesome,SkyWatcher,TRUE,2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,35,3,I loved this thing until it was time to go to bed. Although it dims- the lowest setting is still very bright--like sleeping with a flashlight in your face. I hope they make fixes that will allow the screen to dim more. Also- not crazy about having a camera connected to the Internet on my nightstand. If you cover it up- the motion sensor then won't work. The sound is OK--not quite as good as the non-screen Echo--maybe because it's not omni-directional like the regular Echo. My enthusiasm for this device has subsided quite a bit because of these issues.,Nice but some issues,WMKnox,FALSE,2017-06-29T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Such an easy set up. My family and I use it for so many things. Wake up in the morning- the morning commute traffic report. Recipes- facts- phone calls and of course music! Since I got it and have had friends and family over- they have gone out to buy it as well. Excellent purchase. Well worth the money!,LOVE IT!,frank,TRUE,2018-02-03T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in- there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home.,Love the Echo Show,Tom,TRUE,2018-09-14T16:17:17.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Amazing. I seriously didn't know what I was missing until I got the Amazon Show. While I have Alex Echo (and love this)- having a screen that can connect to other smart home devices is amazing. I love the jokes- random questions I can ask or telling me the weather. Its essential in our house now.,Alexa Show is a Need,NJS,TRUE,2017-12-04T19:17:47.000Z
Amazon,0,5,The best part about the echo is that you can actually use it to watch videos- the security cameras connected to your house- listen to music and watch the baby sleep. I love my Echo Show.,Best Echo so far !!!,Pete,TRUE,2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,"Already had 2 and when these when BB had a BIG sale price- I couldn't order it fast enough! I can see my Nest cameras (another 5 * product)- make video calls to other Show owners- voice calls to anyone else (except 911) and a whole host of skills that are being added almost daily. My only regret is not replacing my 2 remaining Echo Dots when they were on sale. I won't make that mistake on next big sale.I also received 2 of the 'other' home assistants included as free bonuses for buying a couple of other things. I thought that it was only fair to compare the two- disregarging the video aspects of Show. Amazon's Shows and Dots. Echos were like comparing Lambourgini to a '68 VW Bug. Setting up these things are like the expression I heard as a kid- ""Easier than fallin' of a log and not near as dangerous.""",3rd one,Gr8Andini,TRUE,2018-02-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,The Echo Show device connects with a range of services- including Amazon Music to expand your experience. Ask questions and see the answers with the Echo Show- which connects to Alexa for an immersive search experience.,Amazon - Echo Show,Glock26,TRUE,2017-12-08T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,Love Alexa especially the touch screen - can play games- like Jeopardy,Screen makes it,Olivia,TRUE,2018-01-12T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,I love the Alexa system of assistance. This version is great but the issue is that people can very easily drop in on video call and you won‚Äôt get to have to the option to pick up. You need to tweak the settings to make sure you keep it private. I installed a screen protector that covers the camera when not in use.,Awesome device,wagostini,TRUE,2018-02-19T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Lot to learn- but great device. Connecting to other devices can be frustrating- but over time should be better. Connect to my Bose blue tooth speaker- then tried the dot. Seems connection can be to only one device at a time. Still checking help app but limited info.,Great start using Alexia,TheTAZ,TRUE,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z
