Amazon,18,4,This is a great reader- it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette- I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course- this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite.,Premium device- premium price,icwhatudidthere,TRUE,2014-11-07T00:00:00.000Z
