Amazon,0,5,I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. All the features are the same. It is a great buy. I would highly recommend it.,Perfect size for my son,JohnP,TRUE,2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z

Only down side I can see (or in this case hear) so far- low sounding speaker. Could be a bit louder or better placed. All in all- you wont be disappointed in this purchase.
