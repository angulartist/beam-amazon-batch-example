Amazon,1,5,This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads- the great HD visuals- and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too- my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad- but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer.,Perfect tablet that doesn't break the bank,BigMac,TRUE,2017-02-03T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,55,4,I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot- it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection- you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line- I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.,Great Alternative to College Textbooks,Phil,TRUE,2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z

I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20.
