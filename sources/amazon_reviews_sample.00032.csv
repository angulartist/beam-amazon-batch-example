Amazon,1,5,"Love the Amazon Alexa products! I have 1 Show- 1 Echo- 2 dots- and the Tap. Wish the Tap had the drop-in feature. The tap does make a sound when you have the hands free enabled and say ""Alexa"" instead of the blue lights on the other products. Great for taking outside!",Portable,Mike,TRUE,2017-08-25T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,The Tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound. If you press a button then you can connect to Amazon Alexa and she can play your music- answer questions- etc. Downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for Alexa but I haven't been able to get it to work. Still great to be able to take this around the house vs Echo which is tied to the plug.,Great portable speaker,Sparkygirl,TRUE,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap- so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO- the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.,The most versatile of all Amazon Echos,RickR,TRUE,2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,1,4,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music.

Amazon,0,4,Have several echo's throughout the house and bought the Echo Tap so I could move it when I need to move around from the garage to outdside. Mainly listen to music and has worked well. Have noticed that I usually have to yell for Alexa to hear me but that may have to do with the acoustics in the garage. Other than that it works well.,Great model to have in garage/outdoors.,Sam318,TRUE,2017-08-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I got it on a pretty good sale... so I feel it was worth it. The sound is good- I like that it's portable and rechargeable. I think it is best if you have a prime account so you have access to the prime music.,I like it,Frangelica,TRUE,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,5,4,The Tap is essentially a smaller version of the Echo that has Alexa capability like Echo does- but also doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker.

I prefer the Echo- but the Tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their Echo.,Nice alternative to the Echo,LooLoo777,TRUE,2016-07-21T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.,It's a speaker,haiisenberg,FALSE,2016-09-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound- nice and loud- but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them- IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that- it does everything an Echo does- it's smaller- and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do.

Amazon,1,5,I have two Echo Dots and wanted something that was more portable for other times when I'm not near those two devices in my home. I also needed a speaker so I thought I'd try the Echo Tap. You can choose to just press it to activate or you can enable hands-free and it will respond just like my Echo Dot does. The sound is amazing out of this little thing. I love the charging dock. No dealing with trying to plug it in... just sit it down on the charging dock and you're good.,Love It!!!,Pagnmickie,TRUE,2017-08-14T15:16:57.000Z

Amazon,0,5,This is my second Echo purchase. My first was the original Echo for my home and the automation feature aside.

Amazon,15,4,I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it- because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does- but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume- it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high- the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap- you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo- you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that- I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.,Good- but not great,MikeB,TRUE,2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,I wasn't sure how we would like the tap- but I must say it has been fun talking to Alexa. I like asking her to tell me a joke- play my favorite radio station or play music.

Amazon,0,4,this is a very good product- the speakers are good- the price was right. I liked everything about it- other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it- unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good- but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach- you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats,very good product,samboo,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,3,5,I was debating whether to get the stationary Alexa device or the Tap and decided on portability. It's been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we're on a roll. I use it for play lists at work- alarm clock announcement by Dan Marino and news briefs.

Amazon,0,5,"This is a great product. I also have a Dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus- the hands free mode works just like the Dot- and the sound is great. I use the Tap all the time, working on projects- making shopping lists- playing games- to turning on the lights. I looked at the Echo but even with a battery pack it didn't seem very mobile.",Great Product,Venti,TRUE,2017-05-13T00:00:00.000Z
