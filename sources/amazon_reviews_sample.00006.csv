Amazon,0,3,Great sound- easy set up. The screen seems sort of wasteful now that I've been playing with it. Maybe it has the capability to work as a digital picture frame....I'm just certain yet. I was able to set one picture to it...Not multiple. Would be nice if could be used for Hulu or Netflix and stuff since the picture and sound are so clear. I like the visual to do and shopping lists. Still worth the purchase. A good want to have...just not a must have...then again maybe I have not tapped into all it can do.,Nice novelty...sort of a waste of a screen,jcarrio,TRUE,2017-10-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,2,1,"Worthless- except as a regular echo and a poor excuse for video chat. I love my echo devices- bathroom- pool- kitchen- other places where I may need hands free- voice activated music and info. My wife bought me the 'newest- hottest' thing. I was skeptical but then thought I would use it to help on a project. Me ""Alexa find videos on f450 drone"" Alexa ""YouTube is not available"". Amazon won't directly sell chrome products- youtube won't play on echo show. Further testing shows the video call is more limited than iPhone or Android apps for video. So the most useful thing now is the same voice functions that my echos and dots perform. Unless I want to make all of my video calls and check the weather from a device I can move no more than 3 feet from an outlet.",Useless screen so why pay for it?,DoktorJustice,FALSE,2017-12-25T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,"The Echo was so good- I ended up getting the Echo Show as well. At first it was a device that I enjoyed using for various reasons- one being that I could ask Alexa to watch any YouTube videos I wanted to watch. Then one day- I asked Alexa to play a video and she responded by saying-""Google is not supported on Echo Show."" Until YouTube comes back as a skill- the Echo Show probably isn't worth the extra money. I'd say stick with the Echo if you have Amazon Music or Spotify- or the Echo Dot if you only use the echo as part of your smart home.",Great until No More YouTube,Jude,FALSE,2017-10-12T00:00:00.000Z
