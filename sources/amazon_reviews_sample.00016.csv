Amazon,0,5,She's becoming part of the family- but- the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered- yet- anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus- Echos-2nd generation- and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality- but- we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus- further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.,Love Alexa- the Echo Plus is Alight- too!,bleaustarfish,TRUE,2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z
