Amazon,1,5,"Was looking at some more expensive Android tablets to replace a 3-year old device and saw this one on sale. Despite the relatively much lower price- I was originally very worried that the Amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full Google Play catalog. But it turns out that while it is missing some important apps (not just games but productivity apps too)- the more than adequate specs (good enough screen- 1.5 GB of RAM- decent processor) are enough for 95% of what I need from a tablet. And if you can get it on sale- you can't go wrong. Lastly- if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" Fire- splurge a little bit and get this one instead.",Hard to beat value,CasualFan,TRUE,2017-01-17T00:00:00.000Z

Now I can pass that I learned onto my sister.,Perfect for a beginner.,keemakitty,TRUE,2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things- and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet- but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays- questionable hardware- limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality- has a great display- it's quick and snappy- has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system- there is flexibility like accessing storage- side loading third party apps- even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature- it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product- at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long- this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple- and especially for the price- its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that- it's genuinely a good product!,Awesome Tablet,KyloDen,TRUE,2017-01-29T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,3,3,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,frustrating compared to an android,kcladyz,TRUE,2016-11-15T00:00:00.000Z
