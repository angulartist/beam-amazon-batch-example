Amazon,0,5,I bought this as a gift for my sister and every time I see her she is using it. She does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. This works so well for her. A stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. So much tech utility for such a low price.,A GREAT product for the price.,latinistra,TRUE,2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Quite an upgrade from the original Fire. The deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. The new turn style approach is faster and more consice. Still don't know why a chime sounds? Also miss the ease of making notes while reading. There has got to be a better way to organize books. Trying to figure out series- trilogies etc. Is impossible- and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that Amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.,Love this Fire!,ExtremelyUnhappy,TRUE,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,4,1,I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service- also not an easy task- to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming- because when it failed again- I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations- programming- or software.,I do not like this tablet.
