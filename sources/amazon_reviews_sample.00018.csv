Amazon,0,5,I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews- a perfect warranty for kids- and a reputable branding. Once set up- it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far- we really like this tablet.

Amazon,0,3,My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier- so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky- and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets- but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps- but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful- but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall- OK first tablet for kids- considering the price. For adults- fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise- best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.,OK For Entry Level Tablet,BigSky,TRUE,2017-05-31T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,2,1,The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models- they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!,Not impressed with the last 2 Kindles.,Paloma,FALSE,2016-12-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,My wife loves to read- but she was always hesitant to try ebooks. She used to think that ebooks could never have the same tactile feel as a physical book. I talked her into it by telling her its lighter- easier to hold- can hold thousands of books and if she hated it we can return it. But she loves ebooks now and doesnt want to go back. She also found out that Amazon has a lot of books which cost nothing- namely classics and such...I think. If you like to read in the dark then get the paperwhite version. The LED's are a nice touch.,My wife loves it,ianmckaye,TRUE,2018-04-16T00:00:00.000Z
