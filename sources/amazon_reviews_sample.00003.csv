Amazon,5,5,This is an awesome product. This is the first Echo product I owned and I purchased 2 to get $100 off. I was going to split with a friend but like this so much that I decided to keep both. I've being singing along with the stream song with lyrics while doing work in the kitchen and house and watching youtube videos. The videos on Youtube takes a more effort to find the ones I want but I think this will improve over time.,Must Have for the Home,Minnie,TRUE,2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,This Echo Show comes in handy. I use it almost as much as I thought I would. I am still learning all that it can do- but my favorite part is the screen.

Amazon,0,4,The visuals entice utilizing the product with greater frequency. Easy to set up and works well. There should be a manual to accompany the product.

Amazon,0,4,almost a week late from release date from ups but finally got this and set it up which was easy- Once in a while it doesn't hear you right but that's probably due to being 10 - 15 feet away with the tv on other than that no problems,not bad,ileftit2,TRUE,2017-07-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,We bought this to view our Arlo Pro cameras on something other than our iPhones. The Show does a great job of this. It is a fantastic Alexa device.

Amazon,0,4,The Echo Show is great but it is not just plug and play. The app directions are not understandable if you are having problems. However- the Amazon hot line was very helpful. But- who wants to have to call for help every week or two to keep things running. Alexa should be able to talk you through how to resolve her issues. All in all I am getting used to the features and like it.,Not just all plug and play,Goldenspire,TRUE,2018-02-10T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,"If you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather- markets- and the latest news the Amazon Echo Show is what you are looking for. Honestly- the product is top of the line technology- and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it- and read the directions. The size of it is truly perfect, it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand- and with that it truly can serve that purpose. It also has a touch screen- and I feel it is very durable and can stand to last. The sound quality is also superb- with dual 2-inch speakers. It has Bluetooth capabilities as well- but it only works with android- Samsung- Fire OS- IOS device- excluding Mac products. The Echo Show comes in two colors black and white. The product has many different features and functions- and they can accommodate pretty much anyone‚Äôs needs. The top feature is the Alexa App- which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything. Then I believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want. Also you can tell it to volume up or down as well. Another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command Smart Home options. A couple things that could be improved- is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words- and it will search for something you aren‚Äôt expecting. The other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices- so then you don‚Äôt have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly. The price is also fair as well- for its creative capabilities it has. So if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the Echo Show would be a great addition for you.",Creative use of Technology,LoganB,TRUE,2018-02-02T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Love the echo show so much! Easy to use- connects to your mobil phone to easily call people!,Echo show is easy to use,Michelle,TRUE,2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,9.5/10 Rating ! This has to be one of the best AI products I have used in a while. The screen for an smart home device can be very useful. It really can't compete with the Google home because the Show just brings convenience without having to call it. I primarily use the show to turn on/off my smart lights- simple cooking measurements- simple math- travel time- store location hours- calling- and video calling.... and more. Everything else like- news- calendars- weather are already displayed on screen. Definitely worth it if you plan on using all the minimum features above.,Overall Excellent product from Amazon,SoldBytech,TRUE,2017-12-24T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,I like my Show- but i can't say i love it- for being the priciest piece of my collection of alexa devices- it has probably the worst microphone.
