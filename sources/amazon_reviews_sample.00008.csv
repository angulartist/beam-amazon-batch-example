Amazon,0,5,I love my Echo Show! Easy to set up! And fun to use!!,Echo Show,Koko,TRUE,2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,The echo show is a great accessory to any house . It has a great picture on it and great sound . It‚Äôs simple to use . My wife uses it for recipes when cooking and making grocery lists . Also listens to music with crisp sound. Can ask Alexa pretty much anything .,Awesome product,FINKEL,TRUE,2018-01-17T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,3,This item seems great on the ads- but it reality it can‚Äôt do nearly as much. To get it to do more you have to download ‚Äúskills‚Äù- some of which work well and others of which do not. Some are reviewed- but many are not. Connecting is often difficult and sometimes the password you use has to be the same as your Alexa device (which no body tells you). I‚Äôm sure with some practice this device will be fun and useful- but learning to use it and sorting through the skills is a pain.,Not as convenient as ads make it seem,whatnext10,FALSE,2017-12-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,With this you can make calls to other echo shows. Or using the app you can call others that have the a show. I haven't used this feature yet since I'm the only one I know who has one. I can tell you that while using the app at home or away from home off the network you can call the show. I did this while at work to check it out and caught my son coming in the back door. I freaked him out but after he settled down we chatted via video chat for awhile and both agreed it was awesome! You could also just drop into the show from the app to check on the house or whatever- wherever you have it. Keep in mind you're only gonna see what it's pointed at. The camera doesn't move. Plus in its natural form it is tilted back slightly so it point upward. There are stands on amazon the correct the tilt to make it straight up and down. Almost forgot but the speakers are amazing! You can link multiple echos together to play music. I have the show in my living room an echo in my bedroom and the dot connected to a JBL speaker in another room. After set up through the app I can tell Alexa to play music and they all come to life.,The best echo yet!,wbp874,TRUE,2017-09-02T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions- and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature- and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe- not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist- it still is a great product.,The Show is an Interesting New Alexa Device,EVMissy,TRUE,2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,We purchased the Echo Show after using the Dot for a couple of weeks. The first thing I noticed is that the Dot‚Äôs ability to pick up your voice is by far much better than the Show. However- I think the Show‚Äôs speaker is better for listening to music.The screen on the Show is handy for looking at recipes- seeing the shopping list or watching the timer. Could you live with just the Dot? Absolutely- but there are some nice features that make the Show a handy gadget to have around.,Handy Device but has some quirks,MollyLeigh,TRUE,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,1,3,Amazon show is pretty cool- It can help with things like cooking recipe- homework and other things. But it's restricted to only Amazon partner things.

Amazon,0,5,Love the Echo Show. Allows me to control lights- alarm- vacuum and lots of stuff. No brainer to set up. Make lists- keep up with calendar. Plays music. Tells jokes and sings‚Äîbadly but is fun. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with it.,Great device,Jags,TRUE,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,The Show is a great little product. It has opened a lot of doors in the world of AI and home automation for me. It connected easily with my echo and dot and now I can stream music all over my house. The picture quality is outstanding. The only drawback is that Alexa doesn't have a very strong internet search engine.,great product,zephyr,TRUE,2018-01-18T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,We were interested in the Echo line of products after we purchased our Vivint security system. The Echo Show is a perfect addition.

Amazon,0,5,Great to talk and see family at anytime. Easy to use,Family use,Grandpa,TRUE,2017-12-15T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,I love having the screen available to use for certain tasks like streaming doorbell video- security camera footage- Amazon Prime music lyrics and videos- but I am disappointed that Amazon‚Äôs implementation of YouTube on the Echo Show violated Google's terms of service so they got the app pulled from the Show. Also- honestly- and anyone can prove it just through everyday use- but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.,Not Nearly as Smart as Google Home,rainypages,TRUE,2017-10-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell- and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes- you can talk to it- and get results for almost any query- but with the show- you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls- especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon- or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you- but SHOWN to you. Also- when music plays- you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing- and you SEE the news- highlights- etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series- but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used- the screen shows a picture of your choice- making it a digital frame too. Overall- the device is very nice- and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use- so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights- adjusting your thermostat- playing music- viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties- there is WAY more to do with this device!,Alexa is very useful,discwizard70,TRUE,2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Awesome so far. Have used it as alarm clock- stereo- 2nd screen for movies (while multitasking on PC)- news/weather- audiobooks- and more. The news flash can repeat itself at times- but I may have subscribed to too many subcategories- but a quick alexa - next skips right ahead. Still learning the variations of commands- and sometimes it hears what it wants to until I have to ar. tic. u. late. to the point of annoyance- but hey- this is still relatively new tech- and who would have imagined this 20 years or more ago,,ohwelles,TRUE,2018-01-06T15:03:52.000Z

Amazon,0,5,So I was skeptical of Echo Show and the entire line to be honest. However- this technology has changed how our household operates. From my daily briefing in the morning- to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things- I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was- just do it.

Amazon,0,5,I use the echo show to stream music- video chat- and drop in as a camera from my home. You can even see recipes and other items. Worth the money- got it on sale! I always wait for sales.,Great device multiple uses- I love Alexa!,Chuck,TRUE,2018-04-26T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,"at first I wasnt sure if this was something I ""needed"" when I already have the echo but it was on sale for black friday so I thought why not. As soon as it was set up I understood why I ""needed"" this. It just enhances everything Alexa does! Being able to see what she says is great! Seeing and adjusting my shopping list by touch is amazing. I love walking in the room and seeing little news blurbs. It looks sleek and beautiful on my counter. I highly recommend this to anyone.",Hesitant at first but I am so impressed!,Krissyliz,TRUE,2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,Each and Every Version of Amazon Home Products have gotten better and better. This Amazon Home is the Cadillac of Amazon Home Products. The News Feed on the screen at all times along with the options and features that you can do with this is amazing. I love the ability to call my mom and dad and see what they are doing. They are only a couple of miles away but it is fun. I also love playing music on the device since most of songs include the words. You might find out that you have been singing the wrong lyrics for as long as you can remember.,Amazon Smart Home Products,Packermn8,TRUE,2018-01-14T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I like the video feature for my doorbell. Wish it automatically showed a picture when door bell rung. Does not FaceTime. Maybe later. Also not all cameras are compatible.,Adds to my Dots,Steve,TRUE,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z
