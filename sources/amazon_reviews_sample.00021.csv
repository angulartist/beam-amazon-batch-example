Amazon,0,5,This tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. I bought the HD 6 when it came out for my daughter. I just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore- it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.The best quality tablet i have ever seen. Amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet.,Great tablet even for kids,Aria,TRUE,2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,I bought two of these for Christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! Easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. Sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids Kindle safe. The only complaint I have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. This isn't a problem with this Kindle but maybe all of them. I bought my oldest son a regular Kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. Not quite sure what the problem is with them.,Perfect!,Momof4boys,TRUE,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,2,5,It's amazing. My daughter loves reading on it- watching Netflix- going online to look things up- etc. She loves the touchscreen aspect- and the settings are advanced- but very user friendly. Easy to navigate.

Amazon,0,4,I bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. The workers at Best Buy assured me the apps I needed them to run would work fine. Unfortunately I was not aware that Amazon has it's own app store unrelated to Apple and GogglePlay. Make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the Amazone app store as not all are. Specifically they block anything related to Goggle. Other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.,Great price but beware - not all apps work,oufink,TRUE,2017-03-06T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,17,4,I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime- the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all- it was money well spent.,Great entry level e-reader,Rusty,TRUE,2016-10-09T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Bought 2 for each of my children ( 10 & 15) and they love them. I was a little worried about them adapting to a new operating system- no problems there. The sound and playback images are just fine. They take them everywhere- not like leaving their other tablets at home- I'm thinking about buying me one. Very kid durable,surprising,MWoods,TRUE,2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with- but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.,Bad plug,KensReview,TRUE,2017-01-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits- goals for reading vs. game play- etc.Durable- reliable- perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time.

Amazon,0,4,My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case- and we can control the games he plays- and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger- it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.,Perfect for Little Techies!,Mommyof4,TRUE,2017-01-31T00:00:00.000Z

All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning.
