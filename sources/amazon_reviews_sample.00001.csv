Amazon,0,3,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.,Too small,llyyue,FALSE,2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,3,5,I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person- but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that- it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book)- and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another- without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model- which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last.,A Great Buy,Kdperry,TRUE,2017-11-02T17:33:31.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I ordered this for my daughter- as I have the black paperwhite- and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down- or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback- with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight- easy to use- the battery life lasts for weeks- which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers- so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com.,Light Weight - Makes a world of difference when taking books on the go!,LexieCrews,TRUE,2017-12-20T17:38:23.000Z

Amazon,1,1,I was looking for a kindle whitepaper. I saw online for $80. What a deal. I ordered it on line and picked it up in the store. I got it home and couldn't adjust the brightness. After a lengthy time with online customer service I called customer service. After 20 minuets with speaking to a female Elmer Fud that doesn't speak english well I figured I would just return it.

Amazon,1,5,I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school- instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone- and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable- and although I bought a case for it- a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader- and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.,Great reader with long battery life,Stu76,TRUE,2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z

Overall- everyone must have Kindle with them and this is the best product/model to start with.Understandably- this is the beginner level model for people who never used Kindle before. Features like LED lights- White paper background are not available on this model. These features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in Dark without lights.

Amazon,97,1,Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference.

It also sucks that they are 4gig- but 1gig is taken up by the OS and advertising. Seriously? It reads PDFs and needs a 1 gig OS. Lame. The last thing I would change is being able to reverse the lettering so at night you could have white lettering and a black background- so it's less bright on the eyes.,Okay,frheel9,TRUE,2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z
