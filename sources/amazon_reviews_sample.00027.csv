Amazon,0,2,Hi-I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded- she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person- the tablet works great- if you want a google tablet- this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.,Its gd if you like amazon,GoodPC,TRUE,2017-03-27T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,1,5,This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is- a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor- meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p- meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again- if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong- but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old- that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.,AWESOME SAUCE,Boomstick,TRUE,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,4,Searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. After testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. The 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. The soft foam case provides coverage for drops- the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. For the money this tablet cannot be beat - only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. Overall this is a Best Buy for the money- tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.,Great Tablet for Kids,Tony,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,Does what it says- missing one key feature,Nola,FALSE,2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I am so delighted I purchased this tablet for my toddler son! Pros: The rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating- which was crucial for this purchase. Another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own sign-on which works like any other tablet. From the adult sign-on you can customize what your kids can watch- screen time allowance- and add or remove apps for them. The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product. The battery life isn't all that great- but the charger is fast!I wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching Netflix or other videos Highly recommend for anyone with young children.

Amazon,0,4,this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile- plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy.

Amazon,0,4,It works well for me- however- my wife seems to have cold fingers- and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off- and you plug it in to charge it- it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots- and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone- I would tell them about this annoying quirk.,Excellent product for the money.,John,TRUE,2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z
