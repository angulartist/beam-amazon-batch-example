Amazon,0,5,Happy I bought this. Makes everything easier to control.,Use it every day.,eddylaura,TRUE,2017-08-17T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,3,I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same connectivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...portability mainly with a long battery life- but with plagued by connectivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound- when it is connected and responding- is amazing.,Not as great as the Echo,hulio5,FALSE,2017-07-21T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,This little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming. My kids have quickly learned that Alexa is their personal DJ when hooked up to the Amazon Prime Unlimited Music program. Battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes.

Amazon,0,5,I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.,GREAT TABLET,gloria,TRUE,2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift- and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy .,I finally did something smart,ScottyB,TRUE,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,6,5,Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight- the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds- and any book I choose instantly opens- ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing- the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold- and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF- most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words- I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed- and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open- it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page- it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day- I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well- not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First- you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes- but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me- and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second- the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third- this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day- and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18- and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far- but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off- I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now- I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason- I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on- color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction- and to be honest- they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months- would I still have bought it? Yes- I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white- would I still have bought it? Yes- I would have.,Reasons I Love My Kindle Oasis,ljbinion,TRUE,2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,1,5,The new design- compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage- looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours)- I felt the design was kind of make sense.

Amazon,0,5,"I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome- but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint- it's that there is not an ""auto brightness"" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes- but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading.

Amazon,3,1,I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great- so this is not a reflection on them- just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support- perform factory resets to get content to show up- and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly- which messes with DRM- and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning- and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading- maybe this is for you- but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating- as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.,Have never purchased a more frustrating Device,BestPurchaser,FALSE,2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor- which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage- is that it's much lighter- it's brighter (LEDs)- and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover- but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant- hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall- it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best- then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though,Best Kindle yet,JLT421,TRUE,2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,This kindle has made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to 128gb more than it has built in- makes it easy to switch cards so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability,Great kindle- even better than the last one,BobVila,TRUE,2017-08-12T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book,In love,kcladyz,TRUE,2017-06-30T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe- and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover- and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended.,Excellent product.,drdread,TRUE,2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,5,This was an upgrade from my Amazon 7 inch. Bigger screen was the key for me. It's great for listening to music- reading books- watching movies- tv sports- tv shows and playing all the games. Hours of relaxation and entertainment along with Amazon ' s new Alexa.,Big screen movie and games,Roxanne,TRUE,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I bought this for my daughter who wanted an iPad- but for about half the price she is completely happy with it - she even calls it her iPad. I think I may even buy one for myself to replace my aging iPad.,Excellent and less expensive alternative to iPad,Patrick,TRUE,2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z
Amazon,0,4,I go this tablet after problems with 2 Samsung tablets. so far like it. all apps I use available. A little slower than previous tablets that is the only reason for the 4 stars,Reliable tablet,ayc61,TRUE,2017-06-26T00:00:00.000Z
