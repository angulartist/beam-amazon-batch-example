Amazon,0,4,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card- though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like- although I don't. As a tablet- it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet- give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag- and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also- you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store, it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said- I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books- and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality- this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience- look elsewhere.",Good Reader,Theriflemen,TRUE,2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z

Amazon,0,5,I bought this low-priced Kindle to test as a travel replacement for my 14-pounds of laptop. I wound up taking it on a month-long trip out of the country- and it was superb for email- online transactions like buying theatre tix- and finding and making various reservations. Also- outstanding performance for videos and music. All this for $70. Suggest you buy a USB-mini cable if you buy one of these superb devices. yokod,Who needs a laptop?,yokod,TRUE,2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z
