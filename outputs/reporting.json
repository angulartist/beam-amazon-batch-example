        "text": "I've had lots of tablets in the past- mostly from the Samsung line- but this is my first Amazon Fire- so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written- Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First- while this device runs an Android type of operating system- Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said- if you are an Amazon Prime member- this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines- books- etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of \"back\" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen- but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps- but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the \"X\" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them- you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First- you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik- Amazon's own internet browser- Audible- Good Reads- the Amazon app store- a weather app- etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter- Facebook- etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps- however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device- when you have a new issues- it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of \"new items.\" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under \"new items\" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos- however- you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app- which is a cloud-based app.So far- I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said- I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen- you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books- videos- games- shop- apps- music- audiobooks- and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example- if you have Kindle books you've already purchased- they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me- but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the \"home\" menu. It's the \"recent\" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it- but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's \"On Deck\" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member- Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the \"on deck\" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device- but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now- I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office- I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine- anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store- but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys- but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets- but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop- however- that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone- it's not as shape- but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone- the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion- they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app- but still your music will sound tinny. That being said- you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker- use a pair of headphones- etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera- but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also- I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag- but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck- particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag- this device may be OK for you.",

        "text": "Looking at the picture and seeing it was 8th generation I assumed it would be a great device. I had an original Kindle but I stopped using it because it wasn't backlit. I thought an 8th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not. After 25 minutes on the phone with Amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that 8th generation is not supported with backlights. I took it back to Target and purchased The Paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it. The 8th generation one is smaller so I assumed that was the reason for the price difference. Target made the experience pleasant.",

        "text": "I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot- it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection- you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line- I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this.",

        "text": "Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand- Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release- April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles- including the most recent Paperwhite model- I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing- but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise- the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5\" wide by 5.5\" tall. In fact- the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort- For frequent travelers like me- this is a key reason to buy one of these- as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots- no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The \"page\" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface- helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear- better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart- since they are held together with magnets. After doing so- this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear- as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue- and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates- and the page turn buttons also \"follow\"- with the top button always used to advance the page- and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery- so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover- which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner- more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward- as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints- and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads- it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps- but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes- then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit- and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not- but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader- this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",

        "text": "When I first read about Amazon Echo Show- I thought the sound quality would be inferior to Echo because of the small size- which to me would be a deal breaker. I read that the sound is actually superior to Echo \u0026 it is compatible with most existing security cameras- so I decided to buy one. Then Best Buy ran a strong promotion if you buy 2- so I caved and bought 2. (I have a number of Echo's and 2) Echo Dots in the house). I am completely BLOWN AWAY by Echo Show!! Here is a brief summary of thoughts: LIKES: 1- Substantially the Best Sound Quality of any Echo to date- with stronger bass- directional stereo- Dolby Audio \u0026 focused sound field to the front. You can rock out louder- with less sound to the sides \u0026 back- so you do not share your music to all- as does the Echo.2- The 8) Far Field microphones are more effective than Echo. 3- High resolution 7\" screen is perfect for a desk or kitchen. 4- Song lyrics are great! (Free optional setting to turn on lyrics). 5- Photos of the album cover \u0026 the band on all music are awesome! 6- 3) buttons on top: Mute / Camera Defeat with red on screen indicator, Volume UP \u0026 Volume Down. 7- Excellent resolution with built-in camera. 8- Auto presence detector turns Show screen on when you are detected. 9- Speak to Alexa- just as with Echo or Dot- \u0026 Show mutes the volume \u0026 shows what you asked on the screen- with the music volume lowered in the background. 10- Ask the forecast \u0026 you get written \u0026 verbal forecast. You also get a second screen showing the next 4 days- including real feel- a picture of the anticipated weather- chance of rain- etc. 11- Say: Alexa- show me the \"Front Porch\"- or any of the numerous security cameras \u0026 within 2 seconds- there is a highly detailed live video with sound! 12- Video conference - I do not know anyone else with Show yet- so I cannot try this but call yourself \u0026 you can see the picture they will see to adjust your surroundings. 13- Uses the same power supply as Amazon Echo. 14- Sleek shape fits right in with contemporary surroundings (see photo of Show in the center of the desk with 2) 4K monitors \u0026 iPad Pro). 15- The touch screen sensitivity is perfect. 16- Build quality is First Rate! 17- Rubber feet protect any surface \u0026 are anti - slip. 18- Addictive! More than any other device- this is one you will want in the center of your desk- as shown in my photo- because once you add the video component- you will wonder how you enjoyed music- sports- \u0026 just about everything- without it! 19- See your shopping list. 20- See visual confirmation that the lights you ask Alexa to turn on actually turned on. DISLIKES: NONE! I would only offer one design option. I would offer an optional Amazon Echo Show Wireless Subwoofer for this beast- that you could buy later. It would work like the many Soundbars that include a Wireless Sub. That would allow SHOW to not only ROCK OUT- but to shake the walls at the same time!I am seriously planning to sell some Echos \u0026 Dots to pick up a couple more Shows. They are GREAT!!",

Is it the fastest tablet out there? Definitely not. Does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications- etc? No. Does it do everything that an i-pad etc can do? No. But at this price point it can't be beat. People say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. They are WRONG. I have both on this tablet and my other fire- without rooting them. And with the ability to add a 128 GB card it's a no brainer if you want to play games- watch movies/tv- surf the net- email etc. I know there are a lot of people who dislike Amazon and their products- but I am obviously not one of them.",
